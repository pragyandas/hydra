# Hydra
An actor framework for Go - built on NATS âš¡

Hydra is an opinionated, highly configurable, massively scalable actor framework for Go to build resilient applications with location-transparent messaging, automatic scaling, and fault tolerance.

## Features
- Transparent addressing
- Virtual actors
- Seamless scalability
- Robust resilience
- Highly configurable
- Automatic shutdown and resurrection of actors
- Built-in load balancing
- Built-in telemetry

## Testing

```
go test -v ./test/e2e/...
```

Some tests are designed to run for a longer duration. Consider setting, e.g., `-test.duration=20s` to run the tests for 20 seconds.

## Configuration

Check `Config` type in `actorsystem/types.go` for all possible configurations, and the carefully chosen defaults.

*Please note: This is the system-level configuration. Actor-level configuration can be overridden during actor registration. See `ActorTypeConfig` in `actor/types.go`*
